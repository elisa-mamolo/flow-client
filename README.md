### Flow

#### Description of the project

Flow is an app for supporting users in tracking their acquariums nutrient values by having the possibility to input those values in a form of a log. Moreover, specific charts allow to visualize data and present them in another form to the user.

#### Wireframes

Before starting developing some wireframes have been created to have a clear structure to follow during the development phase.

- Landing page and acquarium page.

#### Future Work

:wrench:

This is only an mvp, there are many areas that could be improved, here is a list of improvements and bugs:

- Make routes more readable for the users
- Log route can be called "acquarium details"
- Edit acquarium, date is not prepopulated
- Image for navbar missing
- When ddeleting acquarium the table logs is visible for a fraction of a second
- Navbar could show logged in user, it is creating issues so has been removed
- Charts, data could be ordered by timestamp
- Route for error page if route not found
- Possibility to upload pictures of the acquarium
- A quick refactoring round has been made, but some elements could be transformed in components
